<!-- Build a simple HTML form that you think would be appropriate for a customer to order a smoothie.
Be creative, but practical – what different options might you want your customers to have?
Create a local and remote code repository.
Create a class for a smoothie object that follows best practices as demonstrated in class.
Visually output a description of the customer’s smoothie to the HTML page.
Be sure to periodically stage, comment and commit your code to the repository as you are developing your solution.
Once you’ve completed the functionality of the interface, add some CSS to make the page visually attractive.
Ensure that all your HTML, CSS, and JS is well-commented, formatted, and organized.
Upload your application to a Web server and make sure that the application is functional.
Have fun.-->
